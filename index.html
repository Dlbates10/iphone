	<h2>Water Resistant </h2>
	<p>iPhone 7 reaches a new level of innovation and precision. The jet black finish is like nothing we&apos;ve ever made. The enclosure is splash and water resistant.1 The Home button is completely reengineered. And with a new unibody design that&apos;s seamless to the touch, iPhone 7 feels as amazing as it looks.</p>

	<h2>This is the 7</h2>
	<p>With iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, we&apos;re introducing a beautiful black with a matte finish and a deep, high-gloss jet black. Both the 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch models &mdash; constructed with incredibly strong 7000 Series aluminum are also available in our signature silver, gold, and rose gold finishes.</p>

	   <li>The end resultis black, you can&apos;t tell where the aluminum ends and the glass begins. </li>
	   <li>So now you&apos;re protected like never before against spills, splashes, and even dust.</li>
